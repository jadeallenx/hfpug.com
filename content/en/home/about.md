Welcome to the website of the Houston Functional Programming Users Group.

We are a group of enthusiasts of all levels of programming ability from
beginner to veteran interested in the languages, techniques and paradigms
of functional programming.

We meet on the third Wednesday of every month. We also now are hosting
a social meetup on the first Wednesday of every month.

Please join our [mailing list][1] to stay in touch with the group organizers.
