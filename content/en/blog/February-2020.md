# Introduction to Erlang

Join us Wednesday February 19, 2020 at 7:00 pm for an introduction to the Erlang
programming language and its run-time system.  We haven't had an "Intro to..."
talk for a while, so Mark Allen will be leading a session to help you dip your
toes into the warm and sometimes slightly weird water of functional
programming. No prior experience with functional programming or Erlang is
needed. Beginners are welcome.

We will again be meeting at Improving, 10111 Richmond Ave Ste 100, Houston, TX
77042; [click here for directions][1]. And if you could please [RSVP here][2]
or [on Facebook][3] it would really help us make sure we have enough pizza and
chairs set up for everyone!

Hope you can make it!
