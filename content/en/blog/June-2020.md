# June 2020 Meeting

I am excited to welcome [Jean Yang](https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur) as our guest for our meetup
this Wednesday, June 17 at 7 pm CDT.  She will be discussing:

* We need API tools as much as we need developer tools
* Fuzzing as a formal method for correctness

She is also going to cover some of the work she and her team at [Akita Software][1]
have been working on.

Please join us! This should be very interesting. We will once again be
using Zoom to handle our meetup. The URL is:
