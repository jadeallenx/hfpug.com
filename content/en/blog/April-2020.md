# Functional Geekery

I am excited to announce that our virtual guest this month will be Steven
Proctor, the host of the [Functional Geekery][1] podcast. He will be
joining us on [Google Hangout][2] to talk about his podcast - how he produces it,
how he selects guests and other topics!

I hope you can join us this month on our [Hangout][2] on Wednesday, April 15, 2020,
7 pm CDT. I made the invite public so you should be able to RSVP on it as well as
get the Hangout URL from there.
