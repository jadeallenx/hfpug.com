# Holiday Social

Join us as we gather for a few holiday drinks at [Ron's Pub][1] near Fountain View and
San Felipe just north of the Galleria on December 18, 2019 from 7 until 8:30 or 9. 
There's no speaker and no agenda: you can come and go as you like. Hope to see you there!

We will be back to our usual meetings in January! Have a wonderful holiday season, y'all.
